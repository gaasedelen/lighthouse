# Coverage Mapping
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#    When raw runtime data (eg, coverage or trace data) is passed into the
#    director, it is stored internally in DatabaseCoverage objects. A
#    DatabaseCoverage object (as defined below) roughly equates to a single
#    loaded coverage file.
#
#    Besides holding loaded coverage data, the DatabaseCoverage objects are
#    also responsible for mapping the coverage data to the open database using
#    the lifted metadata described in metadata.py.
#
#    The 'mapping' objects detailed in this file exist only as a thin layer on
#    top of the lifted database metadata.
#
#    As mapping objects retain the raw runtime data internally, we are
#    able to rebuild mappings should the database structure (and its metadata)
#    get updated or refreshed by the user.
