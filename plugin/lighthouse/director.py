        #
        # shorthand 'symbols' are aliases that the director automatically
        # assigns to loaded database coverage mappings. these special aliases
        # consist of a single capital letter, eg 'A'
        #
        # these auto-aliased shorthand symbols were intended to be a less
        # cumbersome way to reference specific coverage sets while composing.
        #
        # Example -
        #
        #  given these shorthand aliases:
        #
        #   'A' --> 'drcov.boombox.exe.04936.0000.proc.log'
        #   'B' --> 'drcov.boombox.exe.03297.0000.proc.log'
        #   'C' --> 'drcov.boombox.exe.08438.0000.proc.log'
        #   'D' --> 'drcov.boombox.exe.02349.0000.proc.log'
        #   ...
        #   'Z' --> 'drcov.boombox.exe.50946.0000.proc.log'
        #   <eof>
        #
        #  one can more naturally compose interesting coverage equations
        #
        #   ((A & B) | (D & (E - F))) | Z
        #
        # the existing limitation of shorthand symbols is that there is
        # only 26 (A-Z) aliases that can be assigned to coverage sets. There
        # is no immediate plans to further expand this range.
        #
        # the primary justification for this limitation is that I don't
        # expect users to be building complex compositions with 26+ coverage
        # sets loaded at once. At that point, shorthand aliases really
        # aren't going to make things any less cumbersome.

            # previous computation of the composition (A | B).
            #
            # the possibility of collisions are generally higher with this

            # mitigate unnecessary re-computation, we maintain a small LRU cache
            # of these compositions to draw from during subsequent evaluations.
            #
            #   eg:
            #       evaluating the input
            #
            #         (A | B) - (C | D)
            #
            #       produces
            #
            #         COMP_1 = (A | B)
            #         COMP_2 = (C | D)
            #         COMP_3 = COMP_1 - COMP_2
            #
            # in the example above, COMP_3 is the final evaluated result that
            # will be returned to the user, while COMP_1/COMP_2 would normally
            # be discarded. Instead, we cache all of these compositions
            # (1, 2, 3) as they may be useful to us in future evaluations.
            #
            # later, if the user then choses to evaluate (A | B) - (Z | D), our
            # cache can retrieve the fully computed (A | B) composition
            # assuming it has not been evicted.
