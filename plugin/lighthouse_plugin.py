    #   NOTE / FUTURE / TODO
    #
    #    In my vision for Lighthouse, I always imagined that it would be
    #    able to dynamically detect and load coverage data from a variety of
    #    different coverage sources and formats (DR, PIN, an inst trace, etc)
    #
    #    The dream was that Lighthouse would have a folder of loaders to parse
    #    and normalize their data to the database / loaded executable so that
    #    they can be injected into the director for exploration.
    #
    #    I would still like to do this, but really haven't heard many people
    #    asking for additional coverage source support yet... so this feature
    #    keeps getting pushed back.
    #
    #    ...
    #
    #    In the mean time, we have a few random functions that are hardcoded
    #    here to load DrCov files and normalize them to the current databasae.
